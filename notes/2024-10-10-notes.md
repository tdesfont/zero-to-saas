## Creating the Python docs for the whole project

First step, we can define the documentation framework that we will use for this project. We will be using MkDocs:
https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/

Open the project as a Python project and setup a Virtual env with PyCharm.
In order to open the docs of the project:

```
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs new docs
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```

## Creating a marketing website for the application (Hosted on Netlify)

In order to develop the static public website locally:
```
cd public-website/react-frontend
npm start
```

Then deploy to web by hosting on Netlify:
https://app.netlify.com/teams/tdesfont/billing/usage#sites

Push the code to Github and use Import an existing project.

## Creating a local version of the React Native application

We want users to store their tasks using a mobile application, therefore we create the simplest possible React Native application to send tasks to a backend to create the tasks. 

```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % node --version
v20.17.0
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % nvm use 18
Now using node v18.20.4 (npm v10.7.0)
```

```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % npx create-expo-app@latest
✔ What is your app named? … mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager
✔ Downloaded and extracted project files.
```

Test the app locally (Connect your phone to your computer, make sure phone and computer are on the same Network):
```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % cd mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager % npm start
```
Enter `a` to reload the app on Android.

If you find the following error:
```
Starting project at /Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager

node:events:495
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

  errno: -24,
  syscall: 'watch',
  code: 'EMFILE',
  filename: null
}
```

Remove the modules:
```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager % rm -rf node_modules
npm install --save
npm start
a
```

Then see the app being loaded on your Android mobile device:
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot_20241011-110423_Expo Go.jpg)
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot_20241011-110412_Expo Go.jpg)


```
npm install --save axios
```

Adding a new React Native component:
mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager/components/tasksScheduler/TaskCreator.tsx

I add the axios call to start interacting with a backend, for now the task is hardcoded JSON object but this is sufficient to test the logic of the application, leading to the following application on mobile:
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot_20241011-110423_Expo Go.jpg)

Clicking on `Create new task` will send a request to the backend (Should it be running locally or on a Cloud), for now since there is no backend, the call will fail with a Network Error.

## Creating a local version of the Flask backend

In order to receive and process calls from the mobile app, we are going to create now a server (It's going to be a Flask backend, simple and scalable Python based routes and backend logic definition). At firt, we will run this server locally and we will then run the same server on a Cloud.

```
mkdir flask-backend
```

Using PyCharm, I setup a Virtual Environment that we can use in Python to handle package dependencies (Flask, flask-cors).

```
cd flask-backend
python app.py

 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://192.168.43.62:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

Now we can check that the React Native application can "talk" to the backend server:

Logs of the Python Flask backend server:
```

```

Logs of the React Native app:
```

```

Note that we have to edit the url of the axios call and that the url of Flask can change, we will therefore have to make that url an environment variable at some point.

## Creating a PostGreSQL database in Google Cloud

Considering the events and their fixed schema structure, we are going to need a DB in which we can store those. To do so, we are going to use Google Cloud SQL (PostGres).

```
mkdir gcp-cloud-sql
cd gcp-cloud-sql
```

Download the cloud-sql-proxy from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy/releases.
Create the PostGreSAL database on GCP, start from scratch and run the commands 

Go to your DB on GCP:
https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/realtimeselforganizingagendadb/overview?hl=fr&project=forward-emitter-427016-s9

Connect to your DB using Cloud SQL studio:
https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/realtimeselforganizingagendadb/studio?hl=fr&project=forward-emitter-427016-s9

Run the SQL commands to create the table from scratch:
```
DROP TABLE events;

CREATE TABLE events (
    eventId VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    startTimestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    endTimestamp TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO events (eventId, title, description, status, startTimestamp, endTimestamp)
VALUES ('event.id.1', 'Meeting with Eric', 'Discussing Q3 feature planning.', 'scheduled', '2024-10-13 10:00', '2024-10-13 11:00');

INSERT INTO events (eventId, title, description, status, startTimestamp, endTimestamp)
VALUES ('event.id.2', 'Sync with Emma', 'Weekly sync discussing the team projects', 'scheduled', '2024-10-13 12:00', '2024-10-13 13:00');

SELECT * FROM events;
```

## Interacting with your GCP PostGreSQL DB from your local shell

After downloading cloud-sql-proxy:
```
cd gcp-cloud-sql
./cloud-sql-proxy forward-emitter-427016-s9:us-central1:realtimeselforganizingagendadb
```
where forward-emitter-427016-s9:us-central1:realtimeselforganizingagendadb maps to {project name}:{cloud region (of the DB?)}:{db name}.

Leading to:
```
2024/10/11 12:44:11 Authorizing with Application Default Credentials
2024/10/11 12:44:13 [forward-emitter-427016-s9:us-central1:realtimeselforganizingagendadb] Listening on 127.0.0.1:5432
2024/10/11 12:44:13 The proxy has started successfully and is ready for new connections!
```

Once the proxy is running, from another shell, you can now connect directly to the GCP DB:
```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro gcp-cloud-sql % psql "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 sslmode=disable dbname=postgres user=postgres"
Password for user postgres:
psql (14.13 (Homebrew), server 16.4)
WARNING: psql major version 14, server major version 16.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.

postgres=> SELECT * FROM events;
  eventid   |       title       |               description                |  status   |   starttimestamp    |    endtimestamp

 event.id.2 | Sync with Emma    | Weekly sync discussing the team projects | scheduled | 2024-10-13 12:00:00 | 2024-10-13 13:00:00
(2 rows)
``` 

## Interacting with your GCP PostGreSQL DB from your local Flask backend

Adding a module cloud_sql_db in the Flask backend.

- Launch Cloud SQL Proxy
- Launch Flask Backend

Go to url http://127.0.0.1:5000/events (Will submit a GET request to the Flask backend route) and see the events stored in Google Cloud SQL:
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 14.35.01.png)

Addition of the ability to retrieve all events from the SQL db + create an hardcoded event in the DB:
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 14.53.58.png)

Check the temporary route (GET instead of POST but triggering an event creation)
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://10.1.6.37:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
127.0.0.1 - - [11/Oct/2024 14:53:51] "GET /create_event HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
Retriggering the same url will fail since we are trying to submit an event with a primary key already associated to a stored event.

## Create a React frontend (Web application) to display the events and the schedule

Let's first create the React frontend locally, the main feature we want at this stage is to display the events stored in the Google Cloud SQL DB. 

```
npx create-react-app react-frontend
cd react-frontend
npm start
```

When testing the full application (Frontend, Backend, DB) - you should see the following:
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 15.16.24.png)
(3 different executions for the services)
Then the frontend will look like the following, where we can see the events coming from the Flask Backend:
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 15.21.41.png)

## Connection the full workflow Mobile App > Flask > Cloud SQL > Flask > Web Application 

Overall making sure that the event object schema is respected all along and that we can dynamically track the creation of events.

Now we can run four different services that are coordinated together (Creating and displaying stored events) as displayed in the following:
[](/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/notes/Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 15.47.36.png)

Right now there are three main limitations to the current setup:
- The frontend and the backend are hosted locally. -> Should be deployed to a Cloud.
- The API url is hardcoded and should be changed in the React frontend (Web Application) and the React Native frontend code (Web Application). -> The API URL should be stored in an environment variable.
- In the React Frontend, when a new event is created from the mobile application, it is not automatically displayed in the frontend -> We should potentially poll the Flask backend. 

### Serving the React frontend in Flask

```
cd react-frontend
npm run build
cd flask-backend
rm -rf frontend-build
mv ../react-frontend/build ./frontend-build
```

Then run the Flask application. Everything should run fine.

Then use the Google Cloud:
```
gcloud app deploy
```

### Deploy the Flask app to GCP

```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % cd flask-backend
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro flask-backend % gcloud app deploy

Services to deploy:

descriptor:                  [/Users/tbd/CodeProjectsPersonalPublicOnGithub/zero-to-saas/flask-backend/app.yaml]

Do you want to continue (Y/n)?  Y

```

### Enabling the connection between the deployed app on GCP and the PostGreSQL database

When trying to display the dashboard, the api/events call is failing with the following:
```
Error: Request failed with status code 500
```
This likely means that the GCP database is not accessible from the GCP App Engine server.

To get more detailed logs of what's happening:
```
 gcloud app logs tail -s default
```
leads to:
```
2024-10-13 13:14:27 default[20241013t151256]  Traceback (most recent call last):    File "/layers/google.python.pip/pip/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 1473, in wsgi_app      response = self.full_dispatch_request()    File "/layers/google.python.pip/pip/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 882, in full_dispatch_request      rv = self.handle_user_exception(e)    File "/layers/google.python.pip/pip/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 880, in full_dispatch_request      rv = self.dispatch_request()    File "/layers/google.python.pip/pip/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 865, in dispatch_request      return self.ensure_sync(self.view_functions[rule.endpoint])(**view_args)  # type: ignore[no-any-return]    File "/workspace/app.py", line 20, in get_events_route      events_list = retrieve_events()    File "/workspace/controllers/events/get_events.py", line 26, in retrieve_events      conn = get_db_connection()    File "/workspace/controllers/events/get_events.py", line 15, in get_db_connection      conn = psycopg2.connect(    File "/layers/google.python.pip/pip/lib/python3.9/site-packages/psycopg2/__init__.py", line 122, in connect      conn = _connect(dsn, connection_factory=connection_factory, **kwasync)  psycopg2.OperationalError: could not connect to server: Connection refused

```

This is indeed a problem of connecting to the Cloud SQL instance.

We are going to try to connect to the database without the SQL Cloud Proxy running. This is likely to be the problem here.

To do so, we are going to use this code reference:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-python-connector?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-this-connector

Modifying the Flask Backend code
```
pip install "cloud-sql-python-connector[pg8000]"
```

We are going to use the official Google Cloud Instance connector in order to avoid having to start the Cloud SQL Proxy when interaction with the database.
