First step, we can define the documentation framework that we will use for this project. We will be using MkDocs:
https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/

Open the project as a Python project and setup a Virtual env with PyCharm.
In order to open the docs of the project:

```
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs new docs
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```
