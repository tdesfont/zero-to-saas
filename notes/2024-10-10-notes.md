## Creating the Python docs for the whole project

First step, we can define the documentation framework that we will use for this project. We will be using MkDocs:
https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/

Open the project as a Python project and setup a Virtual env with PyCharm.
In order to open the docs of the project:

```
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs new docs
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```

## Creating a marketing website for the application (Hosted on Netlify)

In order to develop the static public website locally:
```
cd public-website/react-frontend
npm start
```

Then deploy to web by hosting on Netlify:
https://app.netlify.com/teams/tdesfont/billing/usage#sites

Push the code to Github and use Import an existing project.

## Creating a local version of the React Native application

We want users to store their tasks using a mobile application, therefore we create the simplest possible React Native application to send tasks to a backend to create the tasks. 

```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % node --version
v20.17.0
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % nvm use 18
Now using node v18.20.4 (npm v10.7.0)
```

```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % npx create-expo-app@latest
✔ What is your app named? … mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager
✔ Downloaded and extracted project files.
```

Test the app locally (Connect your phone to your computer, make sure phone and computer are on the same Network):
```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro zero-to-saas % cd mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager % npm start
```
Enter `a` to reload the app on Android.

If you find the following error:
```

      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event

```

Remove the modules:
```
tbd@Thibaults-MacBook-Pro mobile-app-simple-tasks-manager % rm -rf node_modules
npm install --save
npm start
a
```

Then see the app being loaded on your Android mobile device.
